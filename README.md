Simple name comparator library for compare two full name records and determine if it's the same person.

Full name can have different lengthÂ and words count (1-4 words)Â and words order (first/middle/last name) and can contain commas/dots/extra spaces.

We expect to have a class and a unit test to cover all possible cases.

Examples of names:
- ADLINE
- OLISEMEKA ADLINE
- ADLINE AGU OLISEMEKA
- ZAINAB, OLABISI ABDULSALAM
- Agu Adline
- ZAINAB OLABISI, Abdulsalam

Examples of valid names:
- IDOWU = IDOWU
- IDOWU EBUNOLUWA = EBUNOLUWA IDOWU
- IDOWU EBUNOLUWA = IDOWU EBUNOLUWA
- IDOWU SARAH EBUNOLUWA = EBUNOLUWA IDOWU
- IDOWU EBUNOLUWA SARAH = SARAH, EBUNOLUWA IDOWU

Algorithm:
1. Compare the complete match of the rows. If there is a complete match, we return true
2. Compare arrays of words. When a full occurrence occurs, we return true (for mixed words)
3. Compare the occurrence of line 2 in line 1. When fully entered, we return true
4. Calculating the percentage of matching arrays of word strings. When entering >= 66%, we return true
